# Temperature-Convertor-Project-

Temperature converter in C++ is a simple program designed to convert temperatures between different units, such as Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. It typically involves user input for the temperature value and the desired conversion type, followed by calculations based on standard conversion formulas.

Key Features:
User Input: Accepts temperature values and the unit to convert from/to.

Conversion Formulas:

Celsius to Fahrenheit: F = (C * 9/5) + 32

Fahrenheit to Celsius: C = (F - 32) * 5/9

Celsius to Kelvin: K = C + 273.15

Output Display: Shows the converted temperature in the desired unit.
